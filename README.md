# Simplified RAS
This fork removed flash attention support and triton fused kernels to simplify integration.  
Added back support for Stable Diffusion 3.5 as well by backporting changes from diffusers.

# Region-Adaptive Sampling for Diffusion Transformers

**Authors**: [Ziming Liu](https://maruyamaaya.github.io/), [Yifan Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yifanyang/), [Chengruidong Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chengzhang/), [Yiqi Zhang](https://viscent.dev/), [Lili Qiu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/liliqiu/), [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), [Yuqing Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuqyang/)

The RAS library is an open-source implementation of Regional-Adaptive Sampling (RAS), a novel diffusion model sampling strategy that introduces regional variability in sampling steps. Unlike conventional methods that uniformly process all image regions, RAS dynamically adjusts sampling ratios based on regional attention and noise metrics. This approach prioritizes computational resources for intricate regions while reusing previous outputs for less complex areas, achieving faster inference with minimal loss in image quality. Details can be found in our [research paper](arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx) and [blog](microsoft.github.io/RAS/).

Key features of the RAS library include:

- Dynamic Regional Sampling: Efficiently allocate computational power to regions requiring finer details.
- Training-Free Integration: Seamlessly integrate RAS with existing diffusion models like Stable Diffuion 3, Lumina-Next-T2I, and more.
- Flexible Tuning Space: Offer large tuning space of sample ratio, sample pattern, and so on, enabling flexible tradeoff between throughput and overall quality.
- User-Friendly API: Easily experiment with the DiT models by simply wrapping the pipeline with the RAS API.
Get started with RAS today to enhance your diffusion model's efficiency and unlock faster, high-quality generative capabilities!

## Installation

It is recommended to install RAS in a virtual environment. 
Notice that you need to install PyTorch according to your environment according to the [official documents](https://pytorch.org/).
```bash
conda create -n ras python=3.12
conda activate ras
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/RAS.git

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
# or install other versions of PyTorch according to your environment

cd RAS
python setup.py install
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Quickstart

Implementing RAS on [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) is easy. Here we provide two simple examples of RAS with the two models in our research paper. You can also modify the scripts for other usage.

**Stable Diffusion 3**

```python
import argparse
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline
from ras.utils.Stable_Diffusion_3.update_pipeline_sd3 import update_sd3_pipeline
from ras.utils import ras_manager
from ras.utils.RAS_argparser import parse_args

def sd3_inf(args):
    pipeline = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_auth_token=True)
    pipeline.to("cuda")
    pipeline = update_sd3_pipeline(pipeline)
    generator = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(args.seed) if args.seed is not None else None
    numsteps = args.num_inference_steps
    image = pipeline(
                    generator=generator,
                    num_inference_steps=numsteps,
                    prompt=args.prompt,
                    negative_prompt=args.negative_prompt,
                    height=args.height,
                    width=args.width,
                    guidance_scale=7.0,
                    ).images[0]
    image.save(args.output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = parse_args()
    ras_manager.MANAGER.set_parameters(args)
    sd3_inf(args)
```

```bash
cd scripts
bash Stable_Diffusion_3_example.sh
```

**Lumina Next T2I**

```python
import argparse
import torch
from diffusers import LuminaText2ImgPipeline
from ras.utils.Lumina_Next_T2I.update_pipeline_lumina import update_lumina_pipeline
from ras.utils import ras_manager
from ras.utils.RAS_argparser import parse_args

def lumina_inf(args):
    pipeline = LuminaText2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(
        "Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Next-SFT-diffusers", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
    ).to("cuda")
    pipeline = update_lumina_pipeline(pipeline)
    pipeline.transformer.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)
    pipeline.vae.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)
    generator = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(args.seed) if args.seed is not None else None
    numsteps = args.num_inference_steps
    image = pipeline(
                    generator=generator,
                    num_inference_steps=numsteps,
                    prompt=args.prompt,
                    height=args.height,
                    width=args.width,
                    ).images[0]
    image.save(args.output)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = parse_args()
    ras_manager.MANAGER.set_parameters(args)
    lumina_inf(args)

```


```bash
cd scripts
bash Lumina_Next_T2I_example.sh
```


## Customize Hyperparameters
**sample_ratio**: Average sample ratio for each RAS step. For instance, setting **sample_ratio** to 0.5 on a sequence of 4096 tokens will result in the noise of averagely 2048 tokens to be updated during each RAS step.

**error_reset_steps**: The dense sampling steps inserted between the RAS steps to reset the accumulated error. Please use a string separated with commas for this parameter, such as "12,22".

**metric**: The metric used for identifying the importance of regions during the sampling process. Currently support "l2norm" and "std".

**high_ratio**: Based on the metric selected, the ratio of the high value chosen to be cached. Default value is set to 1.0, but can also be set between 0 and 1 to balance the sample ratio between the main subject and the background.

**starvation_scale**: RAS tracks how often a token is dropped and incorporate this count as a scaling factor in our metric for selecting tokens. This scale factor to prevent excessive blurring or noise in the final generated image. Larger scaleing factor will result in more uniform sampling. Usually set between 0 and 1.

**scheduler_start_step** and **scheduler_end_step**: set the range of sampling steps to apply RAS. The "scheduler_start_step" is recommended to be set to at least 4 to guarantee high generation quality.

**skip_num_step** and **skip_num_step_length**: The two parameters are set to enable linear dynamic sample ratio. The number of sampled tokens for each step increase/decrease by **skip_num_step** every **skip_num_step_length** steps.
